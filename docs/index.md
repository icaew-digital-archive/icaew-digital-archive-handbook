# Welcome to the ICAEW Digital Archive Handbook

Here you will find both user guides, admin guides, and useful resources for all things relating to ICAEW's digital archiving efforts.

## User guides

## Admin guides

* The admin guides are primarily focused on the _processes_ involved in the ingest of material into our digital archiving platform and the capturing of web pages via our web crawlers. These will be mostly of interest to the ICAEW Digital Archive Manager and Digital Archive Assistant.

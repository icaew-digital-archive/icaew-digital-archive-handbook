- **Semaphore CLS Client and semaphore-subject-import.py**

  The semaphore-subject-import.py script combines the CSV output from the Semaphore CLS Client, negating the need for copy and pasting from one CSV to the other. Usage is as follows:

        semaphore-subject-import.py semaphore_csv dublin_core_csv csv_output

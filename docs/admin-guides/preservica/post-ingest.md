# Post Ingest

The following document outlines the post-ingest workflow.

This workflow is important for
 * ensuring the quality of metadata,
 * cleaning up the tools we use after ingest for example Preservica and Sharepoint,
 * and linking the resources to the broader ICAEW information ecosphere.


## Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance is currently a manual process. Metadata should be filled out carefully and precisely during ingest, Quality Assurance is a process which is done throughout the broader ingest workflow. We want to be as sure as possible that metadata is correct and accurate. During Post-Ingest work through the following steps:

1. Check for Completeness:
    * Ensure all required metadata fields are filled in (e.g. title, author, date, format, keywords).

2. Validate Accuracy:
    * Confirm dates, names, and other values are correct and consistent with the source material.

3. Enforce Consistency:
    * Ensure resources adhere to file naming conventions and Dublin Core style guide.

## Clean Preservica and Sharepoint

When you are sure of the quality of metadata, it is time to clean up after the ingest.

Work through the following steps:

1. During the ingest workflow we have created a bucket in the ingest area of Preservica. After the ingest has been completed the series needs to be moved to its correct spot within the Root structure of Preservica. 
2. The remaining bucket needs to be removed and sent to the recycling bin in Preservica.
3. Add to the description field of the bucket that you have completed the ingest with a date stamp : yyyymmdd

Often when ingesting materials we have recieved the resources from the G:Drive within the VDI and transfered them out using Sharepoint.

The previous steps can be used to clean up Sharepoint after ingest.

## Add to Catalogue

Needs to be discussed with Niki, Janet and Kim.

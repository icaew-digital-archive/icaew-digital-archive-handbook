# Filename conventions

## TODO: Rewrite the following/combine with previously written notes

Assets in the digital archive follow the following format:

- YYYYMMDD-Title-of-Document(optional - Date|Vol)

When establishing a file name convention for digital preservation, it is crucial to prioritize clarity, consistency, and long-term accessibility. Here's an example of a good file name convention:

- Use descriptive and meaningful names: Start the file name with a concise and informative description of the content, ensuring it accurately reflects the file's contents.

Example: "John_Doe_Interview_Transcript.pdf"

- Include relevant metadata: Incorporate essential metadata into the file name, such as dates, creator names, and keywords, to provide additional context and facilitate searchability.

Example: "2023-05-15_John_Doe_Interview_Transcript.pdf"

- Employ version control: If multiple versions of the same file exist, include version numbers or dates to differentiate between them.

Example: "2023-05-15_John_Doe_Interview_Transcript_v1.pdf"

- Avoid special characters and spaces: To ensure compatibility across various operating systems and software, use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Avoid spaces, as they can cause issues in certain systems.

Example: "2023-05-15_John_Doe_Interview_Transcript.pdf"

- Maintain a consistent structure: Establish a consistent structure for your file names, allowing for easy sorting and organization. Consider using a logical order such as date, followed by creator, and then content description.

Example: "YYYY-MM-DD_Creator_ContentDescription.extension"

- Use standardized file formats: Save files using widely supported and open file formats to enhance long-term accessibility and prevent obsolescence. Consider using formats like PDF/A for documents, TIFF for images, and FLAC for audio.

Example: "2023-05-15_John_Doe_Interview_Transcript.pdf" (PDF/A format)

- Include leading zeros for sortable filenames: When using dates in your file names, include leading zeros to ensure proper sorting and avoid confusion.

Example: "2023-05-15_John_Doe_Interview_Transcript.pdf"

- Remember that the above convention serves as an example, and you can adapt it to meet the specific requirements and needs of your digital preservation project.

# Filename Conventions

> **Purpose:** This document outlines the filename conventions used for assets in the ICAEW Digital Archive.

> **Note:** This page is under development. Future additions will include:
> - Overview section
> - Naming Rules section
> - Special Cases section
> - Validation section
> - Examples section
> - Best Practices section

## Basic Format

Assets in the digital archive follow the following format:

- `YYYYMMDD-Title-of-Document(optional - Date|Vol)`

## Guidelines

> **Tip:** When establishing a file name convention for digital preservation, it is crucial to prioritize clarity, consistency, and long-term accessibility.

### Key Principles

1. **Use descriptive and meaningful names**
   - Start the file name with a concise and informative description of the content
   - Ensure it accurately reflects the file's contents
   - Example: `John-Doe-Interview-Transcript.pdf`

2. **Include relevant metadata**
   - Incorporate essential metadata into the file name, such as dates, creator names, and keywords
   - This provides additional context and facilitates searchability
   - Example: `20230515-John-Doe-Interview-Transcript.pdf`

3. **Employ version control**
   - If multiple versions of the same file exist, include version numbers or dates to differentiate between them
   - Example: `20230515-John-Doe-Interview-Transcript-v1.pdf`

4. **Avoid special characters and spaces**
   - To ensure compatibility across various operating systems and software, use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores
   - Avoid spaces, as they can cause issues in certain systems
   - Example: `20230515-John-Doe-Interview-Transcript.pdf`

5. **Maintain a consistent structure**
   - Establish a consistent structure for your file names, allowing for easy sorting and organization
   - Consider using a logical order such as date, followed by creator, and then content description
   - Example: `YYYYMMDD-Creator-ContentDescription.extension`

6. **Use standardized file formats**
   - Save files using widely supported and open file formats to enhance long-term accessibility and prevent obsolescence
   - Consider using formats like PDF/A for documents, TIFF for images, and FLAC for audio
   - Example: `20230515-John-Doe-Interview-Transcript.pdf` (PDF/A format)

7. **Include leading zeros for sortable filenames**
   - When using dates in your file names, include leading zeros to ensure proper sorting and avoid confusion
   - Example: `20230515-John-Doe-Interview-Transcript.pdf`

> **Note:** The above convention serves as an example, and you can adapt it to meet the specific requirements and needs of your digital preservation project.

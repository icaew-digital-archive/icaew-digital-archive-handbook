## Installing Ubuntu/BitCurator on a New Laptop

If you are setting up a new laptop, ensure Windows is installed first. Ubuntu/BitCurator will be installed alongside Windows in a dual-boot configuration.

1. **Disable BitLocker (Mandatory)**:  
   - If your system has BitLocker encryption enabled, you **must** disable it before proceeding with the installation of Ubuntu.
   - Boot into Windows, go to the Control Panel, and search for "BitLocker." Select "Manage BitLocker" and turn it off. You may need to temporarily turn it on and then off again.
   - For more detailed instructions, refer to [this guide](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubuntu-installation-on-computers-running-windows-and-bitlocker-turned-on/15338).
  
2. **Download Ubuntu**: Obtain the Ubuntu image from [this link](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/install-ubuntu-desktop).

3. **Create a Bootable USB**: Use Ubuntu’s "Startup Disk Creator" or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) as a cross-platform alternative to create a bootable USB stick.

4. **Boot from USB**: Restart the laptop and press `F12` at boot to select the USB drive as the boot device.

5. **Install Ubuntu**:  
   - Follow the installation process and select "Install Ubuntu alongside Windows Boot Manager" when prompted.

6. **Install BitCurator**: Once Ubuntu is installed, proceed with installing BitCurator using the [SaltStack repository](https://github.com/bitcurator/bitcurator-salt).

Methods used to generate end of year reports and statistics.

## Preservica


A count of assets needs to be calculated at the end of the year. For example, at the end of 2021, Preservica contained 12,600 assets - by the end of 2022, Preservica contained 18,428 assets. This implies that the digital archive has grown by 5,768 assets.  

To get a number of assets a custom script needs to be run which exports to CSV a list of all assets and folders. The CSV file contains a column which designates whether an item is of EntityType.ASSET or EntityType.FOLDER. EntityType.FOLDER needs to be filtered out to get an accurate asset count.

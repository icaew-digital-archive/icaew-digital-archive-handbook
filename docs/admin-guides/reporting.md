## Preservica

> **Purpose:** A count of assets needs to be calculated at the end of the year. For example, at the end of 2021, Preservica contained 12,600 assets - by the end of 2022, Preservica contained 18,428 assets. This implies that the digital archive has grown by 5,768 assets.

> **Process:** To get a number of assets, a custom script needs to be run which exports to CSV a list of all assets and folders. The CSV file contains a column which designates whether an item is of `EntityType.ASSET` or `EntityType.FOLDER`. `EntityType.FOLDER` needs to be filtered out to get an accurate asset count.

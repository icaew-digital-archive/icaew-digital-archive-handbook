# Editing the ICAEW Digital Archive Handbook

## Overview

> **Purpose:** This guide provides comprehensive instructions for editing and maintaining the ICAEW Digital Archive Handbook, which serves as the central resource for digital preservation and web archiving activities at ICAEW.

## Tools and Technologies

### Core Documentation Tools
* [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org)  
_A static site generator that's geared towards building project documentation_

* [Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/)  
_Material theme for MkDocs_

### Development Environment Setup

#### Python Environment

> **Tip:** MkDocs and Material require a Python installation. Good practice is to initialize a Python virtual environment before installing the libraries:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
. ./venv/bin/activate
```

#### Package Installation
Install MkDocs:
```bash
pip install mkdocs
```

Install Material theme:
```bash
pip install mkdocs-material
```

Install Git revision date plugin:
```bash
pip install mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin
```

> **Note:** The `git-revision-date-localized` plugin automatically displays the last modified date on each page based on Git commit history. This date is shown at the bottom of each page and is automatically updated when files are committed to Git.

### Additional Tools
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)  
  Recommended code editor with Markdown support
  - Install the following extensions:
    - Markdown All in One
    - Markdown Preview Enhanced
    - Python
    - Prettier

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)  
  Version control system for tracking changes

* [Python Virtual Environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)  
  For managing Python dependencies

## Development Workflow

### GitHub Workflow
When contributing to the handbook, follow these steps to manage your changes:

1. **Create a branch from `main`:**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b craig
   ```

2. **Make your changes (edit, stage, commit):**

    Note: This section will usually be done in the GUI of VSCode rather than via these commands.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add awesome feature"
    ```

3. **Push your branch to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin craig
   ```

4. **Keep your branch up to date with `main`:**
   ```bash
   git fetch origin && git merge origin/main && git push
   ```

### Local Development
To edit and preview changes in real-time:
```bash
mkdocs serve
```

This starts a local development server (typically at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`) that automatically reloads when you save changes to your Markdown files.

### Building Static Site
To create a static site for offline viewing (e.g., in the ICAEW VDI):
```bash
mkdocs build
```

This creates a static website in the `/site/` directory. **Note:** The `/site/` directory is excluded from Git (see `.gitignore`) as it's generated content.

---

### Deployment
The contents of `/site/` should be copied to:
```
G:\Apps\Passport\ICAEW Digital Archive Handbook
```

**Deployment steps:**
1. Build the static site: `mkdocs build`
2. Copy the entire contents of the `/site/` directory to the deployment location
3. Ensure all files are copied, including assets, JavaScript, and CSS files

---

## Documentation Structure

### File Organization
- Main documentation files are located in the `/docs/` directory
- Configuration is managed in `mkdocs.yml`
- Custom CSS can be added in `/docs/assets/css/custom.css`
- Images should be placed in `/docs/assets/images/`
- The generated site is output to `/site/` (excluded from Git)

### Last Modified Dates
The handbook uses the `git-revision-date-localized` plugin to automatically display the last modified date on each page. This date is based on the Git commit history and appears at the bottom of each page.

> **Note:** For the date to appear correctly, ensure that:
> - Files are committed to Git (not just saved locally)
> - The Git history is available when building the site
> - The plugin is installed and configured in `mkdocs.yml`

### Navigation
The navigation structure is defined in `mkdocs.yml` under the `nav:` section. Key sections include:

- User Guides
- Admin Guides
- Useful Resources
- Logins

To add a new page:
1. Create the Markdown file in the appropriate directory under `/docs/`
2. Add the entry to the `nav:` section in `mkdocs.yml`
3. Follow the existing indentation and formatting pattern

---

### Adding Images
1. Place image files in `/docs/assets/images/`
2. Reference them in Markdown using:
   ```markdown
   ![Alt text](assets/images/filename.png)
   ```
3. Supported formats: PNG, JPG, JPEG, GIF, SVG

---

## Best Practices

### Markdown Guidelines
- Use clear, descriptive headings
- Keep line length reasonable (80-100 characters)
- Use code blocks with language identifiers for syntax highlighting
- Use blockquotes (`>`) for important notes or warnings
- Use consistent formatting for code snippets, file paths, and commands

### Content Organization
- Keep pages focused on a single topic
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Cross-reference related pages using relative links
- Update the navigation in `mkdocs.yml` when adding new sections

### Writing Style
- Write in clear, concise language
- Use active voice when possible
- Include step-by-step instructions for procedures
- Add context and purpose for technical procedures

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**MkDocs serve not working:**
- Ensure the virtual environment is activated
- Check that MkDocs is installed: `pip list | grep mkdocs`
- Try rebuilding: `mkdocs build` then `mkdocs serve`

**Changes not appearing:**
- Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
- Check that you're editing files in `/docs/`, not `/site/`
- Verify the file is included in `mkdocs.yml` navigation

**Build errors:**
- Check Markdown syntax for errors
- Verify all linked files exist
- Check `mkdocs.yml` for syntax errors (YAML is sensitive to indentation)

**Images not displaying:**
- Verify the image path is correct relative to the Markdown file
- Check that the image file exists in `/docs/assets/images/`
- Ensure the image file is committed to Git

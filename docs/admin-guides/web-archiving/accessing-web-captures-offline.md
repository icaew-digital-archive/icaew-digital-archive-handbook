# Accessing web captures offline

Access to the restricted captures is via software installed on the digital archiving workstation.

[ReplayWeb.page](https://github.com/webrecorder/replayweb.page) is currently the recommended replay software. 

Access to ReplayWeb.page can be found on the digital archiving workstation at /Documents/Apps/ReplayWeb.page-1.XX.XX.AppImage.

Usage is via opening the app and then loading in the WACZ files which are available for download in the Preservica admin area or are stored locally on the ICAEW - Digital Archive external hard drive.

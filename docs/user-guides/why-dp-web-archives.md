# Why digital preservation and web archiving?

## Digital preservation

Digital preservation is necessary to ensure that digital information remains accessible, usable, and understandable over time. Digital information is vulnerable to a wide range of threats, including [hardware and software obsolescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_obsolescence), [media decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_degradation), accidental or intentional data loss, and cyberattacks.

As more and more information is created and stored in digital formats, it becomes increasingly important to preserve that information for future generations. Without proper digital preservation, valuable historical, cultural, and scientific data could be lost forever.

Digital preservation is also important for legal and regulatory reasons. Many organizations are required by law to retain certain types of data for a specified period of time, and digital preservation is the only way to ensure that this data remains accessible and accurate.

## Web archiving

Web archiving is the process of collecting, preserving, and making accessible websites and online content over time. The need for web archiving arises from several reasons:

1. Cultural heritage preservation: Websites and online content represent an important aspect of our cultural heritage. They contain information on a wide range of topics, from art and literature to social and political movements.
   
2. Historical research: Websites and online content are valuable resources for historical research. They provide insights into past events, social trends, and cultural attitudes.
   
3. Legal and regulatory compliance: Many organizations are required by law to retain certain types of online content, such as government websites, for a specified period of time.

4. Business continuity: Web archiving can help organizations ensure business continuity by preserving important online content, such as corporate websites and social media accounts.

5. Accountability and transparency: Web archiving can help to ensure accountability and transparency by preserving online content related to government actions, corporate activities, and public discourse.

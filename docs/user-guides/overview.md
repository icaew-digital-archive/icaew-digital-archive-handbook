# Overview of the ICAEW Digital Archive

The ICAEW Digital Archive comprises of two completely seperate facets: a **digital preservation platform** (Preservica) and a **web archive platform** (Archive-It and other tools).

The differences between the two are explained below:

## Preservica

Preservica is a digital preservation system that is used by organizations around the world to manage and preserve their digital content over the long term. It is a cloud-based platform that provides a range of digital preservation tools and services, including ingest, storage, metadata management, preservation planning, and access.

Preservica is designed to help organizations ensure the ongoing availability, authenticity, and usability of their digital content, even as hardware, software, and file formats evolve and change over time. The platform supports a wide range of digital content types, including documents, images, audio, video, and web content, and provides tools for managing and preserving this content throughout its lifecycle.

### How it used by ICAEW 

ICAEW's main use for Preservica is for documents (PDFs, DOCs etc.), images, audio (podcasts etc.) and video (webinars and YouTube content etc.). The content on Preservica is far more _curated_ than the web-crawls - having been gathered together into a hierarchical folder structure with application of detailed metadata to aid with search and retrieval. The collections are also far more likely to be complete as items have been sourced from other places other than the website.

## Web archives / Archive-It

A web archive is a collection of web pages and other digital content that has been preserved over time, allowing users to access and view historical versions of websites and web pages.

Web archiving involves capturing and preserving web pages and associated metadata, such as URLs, timestamps, and file formats, in a way that ensures their long-term availability and accessibility. This is typically done using specialized software tools that crawl the web, capturing and archiving pages as they are discovered.

### How it used by ICAEW 

ICAEW's main use for web archives / Archive-It is to make periodic captures of various websites, most notably ICAEW.com. Web archives are _not curated_ in any way - no metadata has been applied to aid search and therefore searching them can often be more cumbersome and tricky.

## Preservica

Preservica is a cloud-based digital preservation platform used globally by organisations to manage and preserve digital content for the long term. It provides tools for ingest, storage, metadata management, preservation planning, and access, ensuring the ongoing availability, authenticity, and usability of digital content across changing hardware, software, and file formats. Preservica supports a wide range of content types, including documents, images, audio, video, and web content, preserving these assets throughout their lifecycle.

### How ICAEW Uses Preservica

ICAEW primarily uses Preservica for preserving documents (PDFs, DOCs), images, audio (e.g., podcasts), and video (e.g., webinars, YouTube content). Unlike web archives, the content in Preservica is more _curated_, organised into a hierarchical folder structure with detailed metadata to support search and retrieval. Additionally, Preservica is used to host some of our web collections, alongside Archive-It.

> **Note:** Logged-in captures of ICAEW.com can be found in Preservica but not on Archive-It.

## Web Archive Collections

A web archive is a collection of preserved web pages and digital content, enabling access to historical versions of websites. Web archiving involves capturing web pages and associated metadata (e.g., URLs, timestamps, file formats) using specialised software to ensure long-term availability and accessibility.

### How ICAEW Uses Web Archives

ICAEW primarily uses web archiving to periodically capture websites, most notably ICAEW.com. Unlike content in Preservica, web archives are _not curated_—they lack metadata to aid search, making them more challenging to search and navigate.

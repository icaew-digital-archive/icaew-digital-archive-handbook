# Overview and collections

Web archives are divided into **public** and **restricted** collections. Public collections are freely shareable with the public, whereas restricted collections are for staff use only. Restricted collections will often contain access to logged-in/premium content - links to these collections and URLs from within these collections should not be shared.

## A note regarding the ICAEW.com captures
Each capture of ICAEW.com consists of the following - a download of the media library (containing PDFs, DOCs etc.), a wget capture (a _backup_ capture in an alternative format to the other captures), a public capture, and a restricted capture. The public captures of ICAEW.com will be accessible via Archive-It, whereas the restricted capture is only available offline via the ICAEW digital archiving workstation. 

## Public web archive collections
